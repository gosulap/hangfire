Currently will randomly choose 50 songs from your existing playlists and create a new playlist with those 50 songs. Like a "shuffle all" for your playlists. I use Express for the server side logic and am trying to implement MongoDB into the project to store user specific Spotify keys so that I can refill the existing playlist for users who have already used the service, instead of creating a new playlist everytime. Right now Mongo only stores some basic user info.
